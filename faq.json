    "answer": "Use compost, organic inputs, and soil testing before application."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should I apply pesticides?",
    "answer": "Only when pest risk is high or damage is visible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a safe pesticide usage level?",
    "answer": "Ideally below 1-2 kg per acre, depending on the crop and pest."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does pest infestation risk mean?",
    "answer": "It predicts how likely pests are to harm your crops. >60% = high risk."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I reduce pest risk?",
    "answer": "Use clean fields, crop rotation, natural predators, or approved pesticides."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if pest risk is high?",
    "answer": "Apply targeted pest control measures and inspect regularly."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do pests affect yield?",
    "answer": "They damage crops and reduce plant growth, lowering final yield."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can weather increase pest risk?",
    "answer": "Yes. Warm and humid conditions boost pest activity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is crop yield prediction calculated?",
    "answer": "Based on real-time sensor data like soil, weather, and inputs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is my crop yield low?",
    "answer": "Common reasons: poor soil, pests, over/under irrigation, weather."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I increase crop yield?",
    "answer": "Use quality seeds, manage water, fertilize well, and control pests."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the yield prediction accurate?",
    "answer": "It’s an estimate from data. It's useful but not guaranteed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a good crop yield in Pakistan?",
    "answer": "For wheat, 35-45 maunds per acre is considered good."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does wind speed affect crops?",
    "answer": "Strong winds can damage crops or increase water loss."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I water crops during rainfall?",
    "answer": "No. Let rainfall irrigate to avoid overwatering."
  },
  {
    "question": "What to do during heavy rain?",
    "answer": "Ensure proper drainage to prevent flooding and diseases."
  },
  {
    "question": "How to protect crops in hot weather?",
    "answer": "Use mulching, shaded nets, and water early morning or late evening."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is ideal weather for crops?",
    "answer": "20–30°C, moist soil, low wind — ideal for most Pakistani crops."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I calculate ROI in farming?",
    "answer": "ROI = (Profit ÷ Cost) × 100. Track expenses and earnings."
